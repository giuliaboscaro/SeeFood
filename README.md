# See Food

An iOS app that allow you to identify if something is a hotdog or if it's not a hotdog.

Inspired by the app created on the TV Show Silicon Valley.

This app was created through the 21th module of [Angela Yu appbrewery's course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/ios-12-app-development-bootcamp/).

Used CoreML with Inceptionv3 model for image recognition.
